🏦 Recon Tool – UI/UX Wireframe (Miro + Figma)

This repository contains the wireframe prototype for a Reconciliation Tool used in Capital Markets operations.
The wireframe is designed to visualize how a real-world recon platform (CME, CBOT, NYMEX fee reconciliation) would function from a user experience point of view.

The goal of this wireframe is to demonstrate Business Analyst, Product Owner, and UI/UX design capability — from conceptualization to layout planning.
